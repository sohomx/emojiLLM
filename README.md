# What?

This emoji LLM is tailored for medical diagnosis questions and their corresponding emoji responses through ReFT (representation fine-tuning) using the pyreft library

# Why?

- fine-tuning pretrained language models with fewer parameters and receive better performance. 

- fine-tuning efficiency, reduce costs, and explore the interpretability of adapting parameters.
